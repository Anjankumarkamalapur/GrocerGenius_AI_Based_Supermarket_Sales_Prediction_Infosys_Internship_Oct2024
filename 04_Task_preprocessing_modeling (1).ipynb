    "### 1. **Imputation of Missing Data:**\n",
    "   - Detect and address incomplete entries by employing appropriate imputation techniques. Consider grouping relevant features to derive meaningful values for imputation. Explore strategies beyond mean or median, such as predictive imputation or domain-driven grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Categorical Variable Encoding:**\n",
    "   - Convert categorical features into a suitable format for machine learning models. Implement appropriate encoding methods, such as ordinal or nominal encoding, depending on the feature type. When dealing with hierarchical categories, ensure the encoded values respect the intrinsic ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Feature Derivation:**\n",
    "   - Engineer new features to enhance the model's learning capacity. Leverage domain knowledge to construct features such as temporal transformations or ratios between variables that might carry predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Outlier Treatment:**\n",
    "   - Apply robust techniques to detect and handle outliers in continuous variables. Use statistical methods like IQR or Z-score to flag anomalies, and explore different approaches, such as capping or removal, to mitigate their impact on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Feature Scaling:**\n",
    "   - Normalize or standardize the continuous feature space to ensure uniformity. Consider different scaling techniques like min-max scaling or z-normalization depending on the feature distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Target Variable Transformation:**\n",
    "   - Investigate the distribution of the dependent variable and apply necessary transformations to address skewness or kurtosis, facilitating better model convergence and performance."
